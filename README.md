## Probability 
### Question 1 Drawing until First Success in the Hypergeometric Setting 
A box contains $N$ balls, of which $r$ are red and $N-r$ are black. Balls are drawn from the box until a red ball is drawn. Show that the expected number of draws is $$\frac{N+1}{r+1}.$$

### Solution
Let $X$ denote the number of draws until a red ball is drawn. Then $X$ takes values in the set $$\left\{1,2,\ldots,N\right\}$$
